quote: "Do your normal work, but take notes the whole time. Open some tabs, write down what you notice about them, and once a week send the whole thing out and see if anyone else enjoys learning along. Meanwhile you're working on something different, something bigger presumably, but it's not quite ready to show people yet and anyway maybe the big project isn't the point."
